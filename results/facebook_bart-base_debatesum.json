        "PARIS (AP) \u2014 France's top judge in the fight against Islamic terrorism said Friday that al-Qaida's North African wing has shown no ability to strike in Europe or elsewhere beyond its zone of operations. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, born of a former insurgent group in Algeria, remains motivated largely out of a desire to attack former colonial power France. It currently holds four French hostages, and French officials have called the group the biggest terror threat to France and its interests. In an interview, anti-terrorism judge Marc Trevidic suggested AQIM is being forced to work hard to control parts of its traditional territory in the Sahel region along the southern Sahara. \"It's been shown that AQIM is only able to strike in its own zone, by wanting to kill tourists \u2014 and we have seen nothing emerge as a significant foreign operation in Europe that was really organized by AQIM,\" he said. Still, AQIM has been active in offering statements of support through the",
        "Loosening Russia\u2019s Energy Grip Is Vital While there are many tools at America\u2019s disposal when dealing with Russia and its invasion of Ukraine, one must not discount the impact that free markets and free trade can ultimately have on the situation. Much of Russia\u2019s power in the region is the result of its control of energy supplies and distribution systems. Diminishing Russia\u2019s economic leverage in the region should be a key component of America\u2019s response. This could be accomplished to a large extent simply by liberalizing global energy markets. The U.S. has antiquated and unnecessary restrictions on exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) and crude oil, and Congress should make lifting these restrictions a priority. Ukraine understands that energy diversification is a key to its own future. In 2013, the Ukrainian government reached agreements with Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron to explore and develop the country\u2019s two large shale gas fields in Yuzivska and",
