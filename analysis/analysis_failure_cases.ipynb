      "A Transportation Security Administration agent who was fired in Nashville after becoming obsessed with a coworker - following her, taking videos and photos and breaking into her house five times - was jailed this week as a result of the stalking case\n",
      " Daniel Boykin, 33, plead guilty to charges of unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes\n",
      " In apologizing for his actions in court Thursday, Boykin admitted to repeatedly filming the woman inside a bathroom at Nashville International Airport and was subsequently sentenced to six months prison\n",
      " At the time of his arrest last year, Boykin was found with 92 videos of the victim — 29 taken from the airport bathroom — and 1,527 photographs\n",
      " Investigators found additional images taken inside the woman's home of air vents and shelves in the bathroom, which they believe suggested he intended to plant hidden cameras at some point\n",
      " Obsessed: Daniel Boykin, 33, a former TSA employee, appeared in court in Nashville on Thursday as he was sentenced to six months prison for stalking a colleague\n",
      " More than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim were discovered on Boykin’s phone and computer, and he broke into her home five times \n",
      " Disturbed: Boykin was sentenced Thursday for unlawful photography, aggravated burglary, wiretapping, unlawful telephone recording and two computer crimes\n",
      " He will be under strict probation for five years once he leaves prison, however will not be registered as a sex offender \n",
      " He also took photos of her clothing and stole pictures from her electronic devices\n",
      " The victim, who has not been named, came forward in May 2014\n",
      " She told authorities that Boykin would watch her dog on the weekends\n",
      " However when looking at some photos of the dog on his phone one day at work, the woman discovered a cache of photos of herself\n",
      " 'I was sick to my stomach,' she told the court, according to WKRN\n",
      " 'I am sure I was as white as these walls\n",
      " 'So eventually I said I had a headache and had to go home\n",
      "' Boykin also took to the stand  to say he was sorry\n",
      " 'I have abused and broken a trust that I can never repair, and for that I am truly sorry,' he told the court\n",
      " The detective in the case, Andrew Vallee, said he as truly shocked during the investigation\n",

      " Attorney's Office forwarded a complaint filed by the victim\n",
      " She came forward after observing videos of herself on Boykin's phone\n",
      " He was arrest after a search warrant was served at his Nashville apartment \n",
      " 'This was one of the worst cases I have seen in terms of invading somebody's privacy in their most intimate moments and the most secure place, her home,' the detective told The Tennessean\n",
      " 'My biggest disappointment in terms of justice was that under current law, (Boykin) doesn't have to register as a sex offender\n",
      " 'Because my main motivation for justice is reducing the possibility that he will ever do this again to anyone else\n",
      "' On top of the six months in prison, the sentence includes more than five years of probation with strict supervision and GPS monitoring\n",
      " The judge also emphasized that Boykin should continue seeking mental health treatment\n",

      " Given the names involved, some handicappers had put it on their list of potential Oscar contenders\n",
      " But when TWC pulled it out of awards contention and shifted its release to March 14, 2014, Dahan lashed out at TWC's Harvey Weinstein, over the movie's final cut, which the director was in the process of completing\n",
      " \"There are two versions of the film for now, mine and his,\" Dahan complained, continuing, \"They want a commercial film smelling of daisies, taking out anything that exceeds that which is too abrupt, anything that makes it cinematic and breathe with life\n",
      "\" That planned March release was then scrubbed, when Cannes expressed interest in debuting the director's version of the movie in May\n",

      " And in this bizarre episode of role-reversal, it is his sons, Anthony and Ian, who are gently – some might say valiantly – trying to broaden his palate\n",

      " But the Whitington boys are motivated by a matter of life and death\n",
      " For years, Geoff was ill, made so sick by obesity-related type 2 diabetes that he had been told he may need a leg amputated\n",
      " Turning round his health would mean changing the habits of a lifetime of poor food choices and no exercise\n",
      " And Geoff resisted with a passion\n",
      " While many would have admitted defeat in the face of his almost insurmountable stubbornness, the two brothers overhauled their father's health, and crucially, his attitude\n",
      " And in doing so, they have undoubtedly saved his life\n",
      " Anthony and Ian have helped their father shed six stone and now, two years after that tantrum in the supermarket, Geoff is a man transformed\n",

      " Anthony, 37, says: 'He wasn't old, but Dad had given up on himself\n",
      " He blamed himself for his illness but didn't think he could do anything about it\n",
      " Getting a grown man to change his ways is difficult and there were times when it felt like it was pointless, but we knew we had to carry on\n",
      " Just the thought of losing him spurred us on\n",
      "' Luckily for Geoff, his sons are just as stubborn as he used to be, and their plan has been a huge success\n",
      " 'The difference in Dad is incredible and he is proof that it's never too late,' says Anthony, a father-of-four from Ashford, Kent\n",
      " 'Physically, he's gone from having to use crutches to get around to taking on 100-mile cycle challenges\n",

      " Before his sons intervened, his exercise routine was non-existent and he tipped the scales at 20 stone\n",
      " He existed on a high-fat, high-sugar diet\n",
      " Sometimes he'd eat three takeaway meals a day\n",
      " Anthony, a corporate financial adviser, says: 'He had an old-fashioned mentality that cooking was a woman's domain, so he'd opt for something convenient and quick\n",
      " Marilyn would cook him healthy dinners but Dad would sneak in a takeaway on the way home\n",
      "' Geoff's weight problems were worrying enough, but there was the added complication of his type 2 diabetes, which affects more than 2\n",
      "7 million Britons\n",
      " If left untreated, the condition can leave a person up to five times more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke, and at risk of foot problems due to nerve damage and poor circulation\n",
      " Rates of type 2 diabetes are soaring due to increasing obesity, unhealthy diets, a lack of exercise and an ageing population\n",
      " Geoff was first diagnosed with diabetes in 2003\n",
      " But it wasn't until a visit to a podiatrist in August 2013 that the gravity of his situation was laid bare\n",
      " 'Dad had an ulcer that was giving him a lot of discomfort,' Anthony says\n",
      " 'He was having to use crutches and going to have the ulcer cleaned and dressed on a regular basis\n",
      " 'Things had got so bad that the podiatrist told Dad there was a risk he might lose his leg if he carried on as he was\n",
      " Until then, in his mind having diabetes was just popping a few more pills in addition to ones he was already on for his high blood pressure and cholesterol\n",
      " This was the wake-up call we all needed\n",
      "' He now loves to cycle, never eats take-aways and counts kale and couscous among his favourite foods \n",

      " 'Dad obviously had weight issues which we'd talked about in the past, but we had busy lives so didn't really push it as far as we could have done,' says Anthony\n",
      " Step one was to overhaul Geoff's diet\n",
      " Out went the convenience foods and in came a strict two-month, 800 calorie-a-day diet under the watchful eye of professor Roy Taylor at Newcastle University\n",
      " He is conducting a study, funded by charity Diabetes UK, which aims to see if a low-calorie diet can permanently reverse type 2 diabetes\n",
      " Step two was to encourage Geoff to be more active, to improve his fitness and outlook on life\n",
      " 'We wanted him to find a social life and hobby other than work and food – we've done everything from fishing to t'ai chi,' Anthony says\n",
      " 'But we knew he had to take up an achievable form of exercise that didn't put pressure on his foot, so cycling became a big part of his regime\n",
      "' He adds: 'Of course there were rows, especially when he was on the low-calorie diet\n",
      " He'd enjoyed food in the past, but it was the wrong food and here we were telling him it was no good for him, and he had to cook dishes from scratch\n",
      " 'It's a fine balance taking on an almost parental role with your own dad\n",
      " We had to be encouraging, but firm, without him feeling he was being bullied into anything\n",
      "' That's where the filming proved so useful\n",
      " Anthony explains: 'Filming the whole process meant we could show him footage from a couple of weeks before as a motivator so he could see how far he'd come\n",
      "' In February last year, the sons took their father on a ten-day cycling trip to Spain\n",
      " Geoff also tried out a sky-dive simulator (he's planning to do one for real later this year), and tackled rock-climbing\n",
      " 'He'd spent almost four decades doing soul-destroying night shifts, eating large amounts of processed food and doing no exercise\n",
      " 'We wanted to inspire him, to show him how great life could be,' Anthony says\n",
      " 'While the weight loss is fantastic, what is really amazing is his new self-confidence , his self-belief and his love of life\n",
      "' Step three was transforming Geoff into a diabetes champion, so he could convince others to turn their lives around\n",
      " Now a trimmer 14 stone, Geoff has taken part in the Prudential 100-mile cycle race, spoken at medical conferences throughout Europe and stopped his diabetes in its tracks\n",
      " At the most recent meeting with his consultant, he was told he is diabetes-free\n",
      " Geoff believes the doctors had been 'too nice for too long', and wishes they had been tougher on him\n",
      " 'I'm just so cross I lived for so long with such a bad quality of life, depressed and basically killing myself\n",
